## What is the problem?
Poverty has striken many countries, even beginning to affect first world countries. Rising costs of living and a lack of resources has made it difficult for families to get back on their feet. A shocking 11.5% of Americans lived in poverty in 2022, leaving 37.9 million people in need of help.

## How was Boost made?
Boost was made with a techstack that consisted of NextJS/React, Google Cloud, and TailwindCSS. NextJS made it easy to create a structured and organized web application, handling routing, server side rendering, and metadata. React did the dirty work of handling the frontend, while Google Cloud handled the backend. Google Cloud was used to host the database, handle authentication, and lookup locations. TailwindCSS was used to style the application, making it easy to create a beautiful and responsive design.
